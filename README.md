# Mars Rover

This is my submission for the dealerOn candidate code challenge. I chose to do the mars rover problem using Typescript.

## Thought Process

By putting the expected Input values that we are testing for in separate objects allows us to handle each rover separately.

## Compile and run

Firstly, run `npm i` to install a few dependencies. After that, do `npm run start` from the terminal or command line followed by `tsc Rover.ts` and open the index.html file in a browser. The executed code can be seen in the browser's console.
